- Have you done any work with monitoring tools like Grafana, Prometheus, Elastic Search, New Relic, Data Dog, anything working with tools 
  and dashboard to help build monitoring solutions? Can you tell me a little bit of the work you did with that?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    I have deployed prometheus and grafana using helm chart in a kubernetes clusters like  
     -- Prometheus and Grafana = APM
            and this comes with
            kube state metrics - which collect/scraps data from pod/deployment
            node exporter -which collect/scrapes data from memory, cpu/disk
            Alert manager -in charge alert us when something goes wrong
            grafana- visualisation
    --  EFK/ELK - LogMGT and data Analytics
        I have also deployed elastic search, file beat and kibana using helm in a kubernetes clusters like       
            .File beat collects data from the log files and sends it to logstash.
            .Logstash enhances the data and sends it to elastic search.
            .Elastic search stores and indexes the data.
            .Kibana displays the data stored in elastic search

What are your KPI meterics?
---------------------------

    1. Keep the failure rate for application changes and releases deployed into production as low as possible.
    2. Ensuring that Service-level agreements (SLA) for our applications meet a high goal of availability. Services should be online as much as possible, 
       which creates uptime goals as high as 99.999%, we achieve this by continous monitoring 
    3. Ensuring continous security in our environment
